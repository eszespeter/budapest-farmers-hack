_community gardens with a sensor_

## short
Budapest Farmers Hack makes available open source technology and witty encouragement to get people to make use of fallow land—to grow vegetables, for instance. Sensors work ‘round-the-clock posting key data online, so gardeners will know when it’s time to do something important like water the plants. Plus, the Hack is a great way to hook up with a social network of like-minded souls—with and without their own garden.

Technology and gardening was separated for centuries because of their nature. Technology is considered as something what deals with the non-biological part of every-day life. What lives on the screens and in computers. Gardening was something what was totally analog at least in the sense of screens, electronics and computers. But in the last couple of years this separation changed and changing more rapidly every year. But how can you deal with both, since technology is more city based and gardening is more countryside based. The answer is urban gardening. Cities might not be the perfect place for gardens but offers unconventional, interesting and challenging environment for it. A perfect place where technology and nature can live in symbiosis if the right balance has been found.

Budapest Farmers Hack is an experiment what tries to find this right balance. It is doing it by creating use of unused gardens.
                                                          
The idea is simple. If you have an unused garden just offer it to someone else who want one. By doing this you gain a tended garden, as well as some fresh crops with it. One who is renting out the garden can have a place without any commitment and still enjoying the life in the city. With the usage of technology a system can be built where offering and finding gardens are easy and by using a gardening sensor vital information (amount of light, temperature and humidity) can be collected, visualized and share with everyone. What makes gardening from a distance possible and provides a database for deciding what is the best to grow in the garden.

The sensor you will see here is one part of the technological part of this project what makes this symbiosis working. And makes it possible to monitor your garden from a distance because your garden might just be too far away to check-it every day.
